    <p>
      <code>Phil's blog</code> is a simple, blog-aware, knowledge sharing about the information technology
      and all problems around it. It's mostly focusing to all the Devops issues and components, solution architecture,
      tools, hacks, tricks, and workarounds.

      that are most important to remember and learn. Because it's just my personal blog so if there is anything wrong,
