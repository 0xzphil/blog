One more feature that we need to request your side to implement. Currently, LITS has a feature for parking time accumulation in the case 4 hours parking time. 
So we want some information inside the check parking endpoint
- remainingPayment: as discussion, it will be implemented on your side for 4 hours parking. We can use it to estimate for full day parking.
- remainingTime until reaching the max 4 hours. For example, user already parked for 1 hours. remainingTime value should be `10800`. (3 hours). We want to use this information to implement few features on Setel app. The property name is up to you (LITS side)

Let us know if something's impossible to implement.
